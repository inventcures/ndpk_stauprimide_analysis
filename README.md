# Stauprimide & NDPK/NME2 Interaction Analysis

This repository contains the source code and analysis for a scientific preprint investigating the structural mechanism of Stauprimide on NME2 (NDPK-B) nuclear translocation.

## Overview

The study integrates findings from:
*   **Bouvard et al. (2017):** Stauprimide inhibits NME2 nuclear translocation and suppresses MYC.
*   **Lim & Natarajan (2024):** Structural dynamics of NDPK hexamers, identifying the A1B5 heterohexamer as a key nuclear species.

## Contents

*   `@docs_plans/`: Initial research plan and specifications.
*   `@out/`: LaTeX source code for the preprint (`v0_scientific_prerint_on_detailed-stauprimide-ndpk-analysis.tex`).

## Compilation

To compile the preprint into a PDF, ensure you have a LaTeX distribution installed (e.g., TeX Live, MiKTeX) and run:

```bash
pdflatex @out/v0_scientific_prerint_on_detailed-stauprimide-ndpk-analysis.tex
```
